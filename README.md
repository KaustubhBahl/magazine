# NITC MCS

The NITC Magazine Committee System digitalizes the article reviewing system for NITC Magazine. Using the web portal, an admin can assign articles to reviewers. The reviewers, in turn, rate the articles on a scale of 1 to 5. The admin then approves the reviews and the articles are published.
The website was built using Django, SQLite3, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
